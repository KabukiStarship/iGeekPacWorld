  In this homework, we consider two 
  tasks: <i>word segmentation</i> and <i>vowel insertion</i>.

  Word segmentation often comes up when processing many non-English
  languages, in which words might not be flanked by spaces on either
  end, such as written Chinese or long compound German
  words.<sup><a href="#fn-1">[1]</a></sup>

  Vowel insertion is relevant for languages like Arabic or Hebrew,
  where modern script eschews notations for vowel sounds
  and the human reader infers them from
  context.<sup><a href="#fn-2">[2]</a></sup> More generally, this is an
  instance of a reconstruction problem with a lossy encoding and some
  context.
</p>
<p>
  We already know how to optimally solve any particular
  search problem with graph search algorithms such as
  uniform cost search or A*.  Our goal here is modeling &mdash; that is,
  converting real-world tasks into state-space search problems.
</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------------>
<div class="problemTitle">Setup: $n$-gram language models and
uniform-cost search</div>

<p>
  Our algorithm will base segmentation and insertion decisions 
  on the cost of processed text according to a <i>language model</i>.
  A language model is some function of the processed text that
  captures its fluency.
</p>

<p>
  A very common language model in NLP is an $n$-gram sequence model. This is a
  function that, given $n$ consecutive words, gives a cost based on
  to the negative log likelihood that the $n$-th word appears just after the first
  $n-1$.<sup><a href="#fn-3">[3]</a></sup>

  The cost will always be positive, and lower costs indicate better
  fluency.<sup><a href="#fn-4">[4]</a></sup>
  As a simple example: in a case where $n=2$ and $c$ is our
  $n$-gram cost function, $c($<span class="nl">big</span>, <span class="nl">fish</span>$)$ 
  would be low, but $c($<span class="nl">fish</span>, <span class="nl">fish</span>$)$ 
  would be fairly high.
</p>
<p>
  Furthermore, these costs are additive; for a unigram model $u$ ($n = 1$),
  the cost assigned to $[w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4]$ is
 \[
   u(w_1) + u(w_2) + u(w_3) + u(w_4).
  \]

  For a bigram model $b$ ($n = 2$), the cost is
   \[
    b(w_0, w_1) +
    b(w_1, w_2) +
    b(w_2, w_3) +
    b(w_3, w_4)
  \]
  where $w_0$ is <code>-BEGIN-</code>, a special token that denotes the beginning of the sentence.
</p>

<p>
  We have estimated $u$ and $b$ based on the statistics of $n$-grams in text. Note that any words not in the
  corpus are automatically assigned a high cost, so you do not have to worry about
  this part.
</p>

<p>
  A note on low-level efficiency and expectations: this assignment was
  designed considering input sequences of length no greater than
  roughly 200 (characters, or list items, depending on the task).  Of
  course, it's great if programs tractably manage larger inputs,
  but it isn't expected that such inputs not lead to inefficiency
  due to overwhelming state space growth.
</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------------>
<div class="problemTitle">Problem 1: word segmentation</div>

<p>
  In word segmentation, you are given as input a string of
  alphabetical characters (<code>[a-z]</code>) without whitespace, and
  your goal is to insert spaces into this string such that the result
  is the most fluent according to the language model.
</p>

<ol class="problem">

<li class="writeup" id="1a">
  <p> Consider the following greedy algorithm:
  Begin at the front of the string.  Find the
  ending position for the next word that minimizes the
  language model cost.
  Repeat, beginning at the end of this chosen segment.

  <p>
    Show that this greedy search is suboptimal.  In particular,
    provide an example input string on which the greedy approach would
    fail to find the lowest-cost segmentation of the input. 
  </p>

  <p>
    In creating this example, you are free to design the $n$-gram cost
    function (both the choice of $n$ and the cost of any $n$-gram
    sequences) but costs must be positive and lower cost should
    indicate better fluency. Note that the cost function doesn't need to 
    be explicitly defined. You can just point out the relative cost of 
    different word sequences that are relevant to the example you provide.
    And your example should be based on a realistic 
    English word sequence &mdash; don't simply use abstract symbols with 
    designated costs.
  </p>

</li>

<li class="code" id="1b">
  <p>
     Implement an algorithm that, unlike greedy, finds the optimal word
    segmentation of an input character sequence.  Your algorithm
    will consider costs based simply on a unigram cost function.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before jumping into code, you should think about how to frame
    this problem as a state-space search problem.  How would you
    represent a state?  What are the successors of a state?  What are
    the state transition costs?  (You don't need to answer these
    questions in your writeup.)
  </p>
  <p>
    Uniform
    cost search (UCS) is implemented for you, and you should make use of
    it here.<sup><a href="#fn-5">[5]</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    Fill in the member functions of
    the <code>SegmentationProblem</code> class and
    the <code>segmentWords</code> function.

    The argument <code>unigramCost</code> is a function that takes in
    a single string representing a word and outputs its unigram cost. 
    You can assume that all the inputs would be in lower case.

    The function <code>segmentWords</code> should return the segmented
    sentence with spaces as delimiters, i.e. <code>' '.join(words)</code>.

  </p>
  <p>
    For convenience, you can actually run <code>python
    submission.py</code> to enter a console in which you can type
    character sequences that will be segmented by your implementation
    of <code>segmentWords</code>.  To request a segmentation,
    type <code>seg mystring</code> into the prompt.  For example:
    <pre>
      >> seg thisisnotmybeautifulhouse

        Query (seg): thisisnotmybeautifulhouse

        this is not my beautiful house
    </pre>
    Console commands other than <code>seg</code> &mdash;
    namely <code>ins</code> and <code>both</code> &mdash; will be used for
    the upcoming parts of the assignment.  Other commands that might
    help with debugging can be found by typing <code>help</code> at
    the prompt.

    implemented in util.py for reference. They don't contribute to testing your
    submitted code but only serve as a guideline for what your code should look like.

<div class="problemTitle">Problem 2: vowel insertion</div>

<p>
  Now you are given a sequence of English words with their vowels
  missing (A, E, I, O, and U; never Y).  Your task is to place vowels
  back into these words in a way that maximizes sentence fluency
  (i.e., that minimizes sentence cost).  For this task, you will use a
  bigram cost function.
</p>
<p>
  You are also given a mapping <code>possibleFills</code> that maps
  any vowel-free word to a set of possible reconstructions (complete
  words).<sup><a href="#fn-6">[6]</a></sup> For
  example, <code>possibleFills('fg')</code>
  returns <code>set(['fugue', 'fog'])</code>.
</p>

<ol class="problem">

<li class="writeup" id="2a">
  <p>
   Consider the following greedy-algorithm: from left to right, repeatedly pick the immediate-best vowel insertion for current vowel-free word given the insertion that was chosen for the previous vowel-free word. This algorithm does not take into account future insertions beyond the current word.
  </p>
  <p>
  Show, as in question 1, that this greedy algorithm is suboptimal, by providing a realistic counter-example using English text. Make any assumptions you'd like about possibleFills and the bigram cost function, but bigram costs must remain positive.
  </p>
</li>

<li class="code" id="2b">
  <p>
     Implement an algorithm that finds optimal vowel insertions.  Use
    the UCS subroutines.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you've completed your implementation, the
    function <code>insertVowels</code> should return the reconstructed
    word sequence as a string with space delimiters, i.e.
    <code>' '.join(filledWords)</code>. Assume that you have a list of strings as
    the input, i.e. the sentence has already been split into words for you. Note
    that empty string is a valid element of the list.
  </p>
  <p>
    The argument <code>queryWords</code> is the input sequence of
    vowel-free words.  Note that the empty string is a valid such
    word.  The argument <code>bigramCost</code> is a function that
    takes two strings representing two sequential words and provides
    their bigram score.  The special out-of-vocabulary
    beginning-of-sentence word <code>-BEGIN-</code> is given
    by <code>wordsegUtil.SENTENCE_BEGIN</code>.  The
    argument <code>possibleFills</code> is a function that takes a word
    as string and returns a <code>set</code> of
    reconstructions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since we use a limited corpus, some seemingly obvious
    strings may have no filling, eg chclt -> {}, where chocolate is actually
    a valid filling. Dont worry about these cases.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Note:</b> If some vowel-free word $w$
    has no reconstructions according to <code>possibleFills</code>,
    your implementation should consider $w$ itself as the sole
    possible reconstruction.
  </p>
  <p>
    Use the <code>ins</code> command in the program console to try
    your implementation.  For example:
    <pre>
      >> ins thts m n th crnr

        Query (ins): thts m n th crnr

        thats me in the corner
    </pre>
    The console strips away any vowels you do insert, so you can
    actually type in plain English and the vowel-free query will be
    issued to your program.  This also means that you can use a single
    vowel letter as a means to place an empty string in the sequence.
    For example:
    <pre>
      >> ins its a beautiful day in the neighborhood

        Query (ins): ts  btfl dy n th nghbrhd

        its a beautiful day in the neighborhood
    </pre>
  </p>
</li>

</ol>

<!------------------------------------------------------------>
<div class="problemTitle">Problem 3: putting it together</div>

<p>
  We'll now see that it's possible to solve both of these tasks at
  once.  This time, you are given a whitespace- and vowel-free string
  of alphabetical characters.  Your goal is to insert spaces and
  vowels into this string such that the result is as fluent as possible.
  As in the previous task, costs are based on a bigram cost function.
</p>

<ol class="problem">

<li class="writeup" id="3a">
  <p> Consider a search problem for finding the optimal space and
  vowel insertions. Formalize the problem as a search problem; what
  are the states, actions, costs, initial state, and end test? Try to find a

  <p>
     Implement an algorithm that finds the optimal space and

  <p>
    When you've completed your implementation, the
    function <code>segmentAndInsert</code> should return a segmented
    and reconstructed word sequence as a string with space delimiters,
    i.e. <code>' '.join(filledWords)</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The argument <code>query</code> is the input string of space- and
    vowel-free words.  The argument <code>bigramCost</code> is a
    function that takes two strings representing two sequential words
    and provides their bigram score.  The special out-of-vocabulary
    beginning-of-sentence word <code>-BEGIN-</code> is given
    by <code>wordsegUtil.SENTENCE_BEGIN</code>.  The
    argument <code>possibleFills</code> is a function; it takes a word
    as string and returns a <code>set</code> of reconstructions.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Note:</b> Unlike in problem 2, where a vowel-free word
    could (under certain circumstances) be considered a valid
    reconstruction of itself, here you should only include in
    your output words that are the reconstruction of some vowel-free
    word according to <code>possibleFills</code>.  Additionally, you
    should not include words containing only vowels such as "a" or "i";
    all words should include at least one consonant from the input string.
  </p>
  <p>
    Use the command <code>both</code> in the program console to try
    your implementation.  For example:
    <pre>
      >> both mgnllthppl

    Let's find a way to speed up joint space and vowel insertion with A*.
    Recall that one way to find the heuristic function $h(s)$ for A* is to define a relaxed search problem $P_{rel}$ where $Cost_{rel}(s, a) \leq Cost(s, a)$ and letting $h(s) = FutureCost_{rel}(s)$. <br><br>

    Given a bigram model $b$ (a function that takes any $(w',w)$ and returns a number),
    define a unigram model $u_b$ (a function that takes any $w$ and returns a number)
    based on $b$. <br><br>

    Use this function $u_b$ to help define $P_{rel}$.

    <p>One example of a $u_b$ is $u_b(w) = b(w, w)$. However this will not lead to a consistent heuristic because $Cost_{rel}(s, a)$ is not guaranteed to be less than or equal to $Cost(s, a)$
