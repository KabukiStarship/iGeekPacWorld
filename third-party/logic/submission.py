# Problem 6: semantic parsing (extra credit)
# Each of the following functions should return a GrammarRule.
# Look at createBaseEnglishGrammar() in nlparser.py to see what these rules should look like.
# For example, the rule for 'X is a Y' is:
#     GrammarRule('$Clause', ['$Name', 'is', 'a', '$Noun'],
#                 lambda args: Atom(args[1].title(), args[0].lower()))
# Note: args[0] corresponds to $Name and args[1] corresponds to $Noun.
# Note: by convention, .title() should be applied to all predicates (e.g., Cat).
# Note: by convention, .lower() should be applied to constant symbols (e.g., garfield).
